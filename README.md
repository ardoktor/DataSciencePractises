# DataSciencePractises
Hello Everyone I am Arda and I am trying to develope myself on data science and I'll be sharing my works here. 

I am applying different tools and methods in order to thrive more on data. Some of the works shared here are implementation of common methods, examples. I am getting help from many online sources such as books, courses and videos. Even though, they are not perfect or unique I just wanted to show my work and be able to follow my progress. 


[Practice projects directory](PracticeProjects) contains relatively smaller works and focused on single tool mostly. For example Exploring e bay car sales emphasizes usage of pandas.
